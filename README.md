# Twitter to Discord using Webhooks
This is a new version of "TweetMonitor" tool that I shared few weeks ago. In this new program, the tweets are posted onto a discord server instead of desktop notifications.

### Key Updates
* Instead of desktop notifications, tweets are send to discord server.
* Monitoring frequency is 1 sec. Feel free to customize it in the setInterval function of the code.
* Latency is around 2-3 secs.
* No need of access keys as this is implemented using web-scraping technique.
